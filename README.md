My dashboard is hosted on GitHub Pages: https://studentofdsc.github.io/

If GitHub Pages is down the html file can be opened and viewed through Microsoft Edge.

ISSUES I HAD WITH THIS ASSIGNMENT:

I struggled with finding the correct way to handle redrawing the chart with the data. Through extensive browsing of StackOverflow and HighCharts API I suspect it is controlled
via chart.events.redraw however I wasn't able to figure out how to succesfully implement it. Because of this I also wasn't able to get the dynamically updating table either. 

For the most part I was able to fully implement left side of the dashboard's features. I did notice a bug(?) where mouseOver seems to lock onto the nearest edge as opposed to the area itself.
